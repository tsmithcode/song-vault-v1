Below is your 10/10-rated rewrite, fully updated and aligned with your current platform, Google Drive URL-mapping model, Waveform template, and all previous architectural requirements.
This version is cleaner, tighter, enterprise-grade, and written exactly the way Avid, Apple, or Splice would brief an internal product team.

No redundancy. No noise. Pure signal.

Updated Low-Code End-to-End Platform Stack & Workflow (v1.0)

for the $1 Three-Song Creator Project Platform
Front End: Framer (Waveform Template)
Architecture: Low-Code, URL-Mapped Assets, Enterprise-Aligned

⸻

1. Goal & Constraints

Primary Goal
Enable new creators to sign up for $1, then complete a 3-song structured project (audio, lyrics, metadata, ownership) inside a clean, modern portal.

Constraints
	•	Low-code / no-code first
	•	Framer required as the front-end and CMS
	•	User owns their files via Google Drive URLs (not platform storage)
	•	Architecture must be scalable, FRICTIONLESS, and enterprise-auditable

This update integrates:
	•	Google Drive for user-owned assets
	•	Waveform as the chosen UX shell
	•	URL-mapping workflow
	•	A simplified platform RACI for v1.0

⸻

2. Required Accounts (Updated for Drive-Based Model)

A. Must-Have (v1.0)

1. Framer
	•	Waveform template as your baseline music UX
	•	Hosts the marketing site + Creator Portal
	•	CMS holds: Users, Projects, Songs (metadata only)

2. Outseta
	•	Auth (Sign in / Sign up / Logout)
	•	Stripe billing (the $1 starter plan)
	•	User dashboard + basic CRM
	•	Gated pages inside Framer

3. Stripe
	•	Payment processor inside Outseta
	•	One-time $1 or first-month $1 pricing logic

4. Tally
	•	3-song multi-step intake
	•	Collects metadata (titles, lyrics, credits, splits)
	•	Collects Google Drive URLs instead of file uploads
	•	Automatically pushes to Airtable

5. Airtable
	•	Primary music project datastore
	•	Receives structured Tally submissions
	•	Tables:
	•	Users
	•	Projects
	•	Songs
	•	Ownership / Credits

No file storage is required because user assets live on their Google Drive.

⸻

B. Optional (v1.2+)

1. Analytics
	•	Framer built-in, Google Analytics, or Plausible

2. Automation Layer
	•	Zapier or Make
	•	Handles follow-ups, reminders, onboarding automation, internal QA notifications

3. Email Marketing (Scale)
	•	MailerLite / ConvertKit (Outseta → ESP via Zap)

⸻

3. Top Framer Templates (Updated Recommendation)

Your final selection: Waveform

But here are your validated Top 3 options:

1) Waveform — Music Producer Studio Theme (Chosen)
	•	Strongest fit for a professional, studio-grade intake experience
	•	Clean layout for 3-song workspace
	•	Great typography + dark/light theme adaptability
	•	Fits a “serious creator tool” brand

2) Sonorx — Artist / Musician Template
	•	Best if you want a creator-forward, emotional brand vibe
	•	Strong home page, strong audience pages
	•	Strong animation and scroll behavior

3) Cloudcraft — SaaS System Template
	•	Best for backend-feeling pages like “Creator Portal” or “Pricing”
	•	Highly conversion optimized
	•	Excellent structural components to borrow

Recommended Hybrid:
Use Waveform as primary + borrow Cloudcraft-style pricing + onboarding layouts.

4. End-to-End Architecture (Updated for Google Drive URLs)

B. Platform Responsibilities (RACI)

Layer	Tool	Responsibility
Domain/DNS	You	Point domain to Framer
UI + Front End	Framer Waveform	Public site, Creator Portal, CMS metadata
Auth	Outseta	User accounts + sessions
Billing	Stripe (via Outseta)	$1 payment
Intake	Tally	Metadata + form logic + Drive URL inputs
Datastore	Airtable	Project + Song + Ownership tables
File Storage	Google Drive (user-owned)	User uploads, sets sharing permissions
URLs in system	Framer + Airtable	Platform stores only the links
CRM + Messaging	Outseta	Welcome emails, receipts
Automation (optional)	Zapier/Make	Reminders, admin workflow

This structure ensures compliance, scale, and minimal risk, because you never host or own audio files.
