Great. Let’s turn those ASCII screens into a Framer build spec: CMS, components, and wiring so you can actually implement Waveform + Outseta + Tally with minimal friction.

I’ll keep it tight and practical.

⸻

1. Framer CMS Architecture

You need 3 core collections to power everything you’ve drawn:
	1.	Creators
	2.	Projects
	3.	Songs

You can add an Assets collection later if you want deeper audio breakdown.

1.1 Creators Collection

Represents each paying user / artist identity.

Fields:
	•	name (Text) – public display name (“Thrizz13”)
	•	slug (Slug) – used if you ever want public creator pages
	•	email (Text) – to map to Airtable/Outseta (internal)
	•	country (Text or Option)
	•	primaryRole (Option: Artist, Producer, Songwriter, All)
	•	avatar (Image, optional)
	•	bio (Rich text, optional)

Relations:
	•	projects (Reference, multiple) – link to Projects (reverse is primary)

For v0 you can populate this manually from your Airtable/Outseta user list. Automation can come later.

⸻

1.2 Projects Collection

Each 3-song bundle.

Fields:
	•	title (Text) – e.g. “Midnight EP”
	•	slug (Slug) – used for /creator/projects/[slug]
	•	creator (Reference → Creators)
	•	genre (Option/Text)
	•	intendedUse (Option: Demo, Label pitch, Distribution-ready, Collab)
	•	status (Option: In setup, In review, Complete, Archived)
	•	year (Number/Text)
	•	labelImprint (Text)

	•	songCount (Number – store 3)
	•	progressPercent (Number 0–100)
	•	lastUpdated (Date/Time)
	•	createdAt (Date/Time)
	•	notes (Rich text, optional)

Relations:
	•	songs (Reference, multiple → Songs) – 3 per project

⸻

1.3 Songs Collection

Individual tracks under a project.

Fields:
	•	title (Text) – “Twerk Alot”
	•	slug (Slug) – used for /creator/projects/[project]/songs/[slug]
	•	project (Reference → Projects)
	•	trackNumber (Number 1–3)
	•	type (Option: Explicit, Clean, Instrumental)
	•	status (Option: Not started, Audio only, Lyrics added, Ready to export)
	•	audioUrl (URL – final mix)
	•	stemsUrl (URL – zipped stems or drive link)
	•	duration (Text number or MM:SS string)
	•	tempoBpm (Number)
	•	key (Text: “C Minor”)
	•	daw (Text)
	•	artistName (Text – display only)
	•	producerName (Text)
	•	mixEngineer (Text)
	•	masterEngineer (Text)
	•	lyrics (Rich text)
	•	lyricsPreview (Text, auto-filled excerpt if you want)
	•	splitsSummary (Rich text – pasted from Tally/Airtable for now)
	•	rightsStatus (Option: Draft, Confirmed)
	•	reviewNotes (Rich text, for your internal notes)
	•	createdAt (Date/Time)
	•	updatedAt (Date/Time)

⸻

2. Component System in Framer

Use the Waveform template’s layout as your base and layer these reusable components.

2.1 Layout Components

⸻

3. Page Wiring (Framer + CMS + External Systems)

3.1 Landing /
	•	Wrap with AppShell (public variant).
	•	Static content; no CMS needed here.
	•	Buttons:
	•	Start for $1 → /pricing
	•	Login → /login

⸻

3.2 Pricing /pricing
	•	AppShell (public).
	•	PageHeader with title “3-Song Project Beta”.
	•	A PlanCard (just a styled SectionCard or dedicated component).
	•	Button:
	•	Continue – Pay $1:
	•	Open Outseta checkout (their embed or hosted link).
	•	On success, Outseta redirect → /onboard/project-setup?step=1.

⸻

3.3 Login /login
	•	AppShell (public).
	•	Centered SectionCard with:
	•	PageHeader “Log in to your creator portal”
	•	Outseta login widget embed (HTML embed box in Framer).

⸻

3.4 Onboarding Wizard (3 steps)

These can be 3 separate Framer pages, or 1 page with section variants; simplest is 3 pages:

/onboard/project-setup?step=1
	•	AppShell (auth variant).
	•	Use a simple Framer form or embed a tiny Tally form:
	•	On submit:
	•	Send data to Tally/Airtable, and optionally call an internal API later.
	•	Navigate to step 2.

/onboard/project-setup?step=2
	•	Same pattern; on submit → step 3.

/onboard/project-setup?step=3
	•	Song shell names + explicit/clean type.
	•	On submit:
	•	Tally saves all three songs + project into Airtable.
	•	You (for v0) manually create a Project entry in Framer CMS with:
	•	creator reference
	•	songs created under Songs collection (with track numbers and titles).
	•	Navigate to /creator/home.

Later, automation (Whalesync/Make) can mirror Airtable → Framer CMS.

⸻

3.5 Creator Home /creator/home
	•	AppShell (auth).
	•	PageHeader: “Welcome back, [Creator.name]”
	•	Use Creators CMS if you want dynamic name; for v0 you can hardcode your own.

Main layout:
	1.	Current Project Card
	•	Connect ProjectCard to a single Projects item:
	•	Either filter by creator and status != Archived and pick the most recent.
	•	Or manually set one as “primary” for now.
	2.	Library Table/List
	•	Data source: Projects collection filtered by creator.
	•	You can use a simple stacked list of ProjectCards or a table component.

⸻

3.6 Project Console /creator/projects/[slug]

This is a dynamic CMS page for Projects.
	•	In Framer:
	•	Create a CMS Collection Page bound to Projects.
	•	Use field bindings:
	•	title → H1
	•	genre, intendedUse, status, progressPercent, etc.

Sections:
	1.	Header:
	•	PageHeader with:
	•	Title: Project.title
	•	Subtitle: [Creator.name] · {songCount} songs • {genre} • {intendedUse}
	•	StatusPill bound to status
	•	ProgressBar bound to progressPercent
	2.	“Next best action”:
	•	For v0, static text like “Upload audio for your first song”.
	•	Later: if any Song has status = Not started, show link to [first such song].
	3.	Songs list:
	•	Add a “List” block for Songs in Framer with the filter:
	•	project = Current Project
	•	Use SongRow component as the template.
	•	Bind:
	•	trackNumber, title
	•	Audio/Lyrics/Splits status from Song fields
	•	href: link to /creator/projects/[project.slug]/songs/[song.slug] (CMS nested routing or manual link if needed).

⸻

3.7 Song Workspace /creator/projects/[slug]/songs/[song-slug]

You’ll make this a CMS Collection Page for Songs.
	•	In Framer:
	•	Create collection page for Songs.
	•	Use nested info:
	•	Access the parent project via the project reference.

Header binding:
	•	H1: Song.title
	•	Subtitle: [Song.project.creator.name] · Part of {Song.project.title}
	•	Status pill: bound to Song.status
	•	“Back to project” link: /creator/projects/[Song.project.slug]

Sections:
	1.	Section 1 – Audio (AudioCard)
	•	If audioUrl is empty → show “Drop file / Browse” UI (low-code: just link to a small upload Tally form, or dummy placeholder for now).
	•	If audioUrl has value → standard HTML audio player sourced from audioUrl.
	2.	Section 2 – Credits & Tech (SectionCard)
	•	Bind text rows to:
	•	artistName, producerName, daw, tempoBpm, key, mixEngineer, masterEngineer.
	•	For v0, a small “Edit credits” button can link out to an admin-only Tally form (you fill it yourself).
	3.	Section 3 – Lyrics
	•	Collapsible SectionCard:
	•	Title: “Lyrics”
	•	Closed state: show lyricsPreview or first line of lyrics.
	•	Open state: show full lyrics rich text.
	4.	Section 4 – Ownership & Splits
	•	Read-only block bound to splitsSummary + rightsStatus.
	•	Link “View full rights summary” can go to a static page or PDF (for now, maybe N/A).
	5.	Section 5 – Export & Review
	•	Static instructions at v0:
	•	Show “Project readiness: X of 3 songs complete” (if you manually keep status/progressPercent in sync).
	•	Back to project button linking to /creator/projects/[Song.project.slug].

⸻

4. Animations (Specific, but Simple)

You can implement these with Framer’s built-in Variant & Scroll features:
	•	ProjectCard
	•	Default: slight elevation, neutral background.
	•	Hover: scale: 1.02, y: -3, soft shadow.
	•	Entrance: opacity: 0 → 1, y: 10 → 0 on scroll in.
	•	SongRow
	•	Hover background: var(--surfaceHover) with arrow icon sliding 4px to the right.
	•	Page transitions
	•	Page-level:
	•	Landing → Pricing: fade.
	•	Creator Home → Project: slide from right.
	•	Project → Song: slide from right with slight scale.
	•	SectionCard
	•	When appearing (especially in Song Workspace):
	•	Use staggered fade-in (100–150ms offset) for Audio → Credits → Lyrics → Splits → Export.
	•	Lyrics collapse
	•	Height animation and opacity; arrow flips 180°.

All of this can be done with Framer’s visual controls—no custom code required.

5. Data Flow vs Implementation Reality

For v0, your actual operational flow is:
	1.	User signs up and pays $1 via Outseta/Stripe.
	2.	Onboarding wizard (Framer + Tally) writes to Airtable.
	3.	You (or an assistant) periodically sync:
	•	Create/update Creators, Projects, Songs in Framer CMS based on Airtable rows.
	4.	The Framer UI (Creator Home, Project Console, Song Workspace) is read-only or lightly editable.

Later, when you’re ready to eliminate manual sync, add one non-redundant system:
	•	A syncing layer (Whalesync, Make, or a tiny custom script) to push Airtable → Framer CMS.

Until then, everything above works with the accounts you already planned: Framer, Outseta, Stripe, Tally, Airtable.

If you’d like, next step I can give you a build checklist, day-by-day or step-by-step inside Framer (exact order: create CMS, build components, then pages, then hook Outseta/Tally).
