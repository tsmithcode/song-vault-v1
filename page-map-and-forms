CTA Footer: “Ready? Start for $1” → Outseta.

⸻

⸻

Page (Gated or Outseta-hosted): /account

	•	This is where they can:
	•	Update payment method
	•	See their $1 charge
	•	Cancel any future plans (if you add subscriptions later)

⸻

If you’d like, next step we can:
	•	Turn this into a build checklist (Day 1–3 tasks in Framer, Tally, Outseta, Airtable), or
	•	Design the v0 email flows (welcome, nudge to complete form, post-submission follow-up) that match your $1 beta positioning.
