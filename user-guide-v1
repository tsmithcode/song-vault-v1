Below is the official, enterprise-grade User Guide for your platform—written as if Apple, Avid, or Adobe produced it.
It is non-redundant, aligned exactly to your ASCII screens, workflows, systems (Framer + Outseta + Tally + Airtable + Google Drive URL mapping), and the 3-song project onboarding architecture.

This guide is structured as a real product manual for first-time users.
